## üîß Key Technical Features

### 1. AdWebView Component
```swift
AdWebView(
    adUnitId: "div-gpt-ad-mobile_1",
    adSize: $adSize,
    predefinedHeight: 320,  // Optional: prevents content shifting
    showAdLabel: true       // Shows "annonce" label above ad
)
.frame(width: adSize.width, height: adSize.height)
```

### 2. SDK Configuration (Global Level)
```swift
let config = AdConfiguration(
    baseURL: "https://your-domain.com/ad-template.html",
    didomiApiKey: "your-didomi-api-key",
    debugMode: true,
    lazyLoadingFetch: 200,  // Distance (px) to start WebView loading and YM fetching
    lazyLoadingRender: 100, // Distance (px) to trigger YM ad display/impression
    unloadOnNavigation: true, // Global: Auto-unload WebViews on view changes
    showAdLabels: true      // Global: Show "annonce" labels on all ad units
)
```

### 3. Initialization
```swift
WebAdView.shared.initialize(
    didomiApiKey: "your-didomi-api-key",
)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### HTML Template Features
- Didomi consent integration
- Yield Manager ad loading with two-phase approach:
  - **Fetch Phase**: Use `ayManager.fetch()` for pre-loading without display
  - **Render Phase**: Use `ayManager.display()` for actual ad rendering
- Size detection and reporting
- Debug logging capabilities
- Visibility tracking support
- Event-driven size recheck using YM/GPT events (on ad refresh)
- Predefined ad size constraints (320x320, 300x250, etc.)

### Native-Web Bridge
- **Native ‚Üí Web**: Consent status, visibility changes, configuration, navigation events, fetch/render signals
- **Web ‚Üí Native**: Size updates, ad events, console logs, errors, refresh event triggers

### Viewability Solution
1. **Native Observer**: Track WebView position relative to screen
2. **Event Broadcasting**: Send visibility events to WebView
3. **CSS Class Toggle**: Hide/show ads based on visibility
4. **Intersection Tracking**: Monitor 50% visibility threshold

### Lazy Loading Implementation
1. **Two-Tier Loading System**:
   - **Fetch Tier**: At configurable distance (e.g., 200px):
     - Load/create the WKWebView in native view
     - Send JS fetch event to trigger `ayManager.fetch()`
   - **Render Tier**: At closer distance (e.g., 100px), send JS display event for `ayManager.display()`
2. **Scroll Observer**: Monitor scroll position in parent view with dual thresholds
3. **State Management**: Track WebView creation, fetch, and render states to prevent duplicate operations

## üé® Advanced Features

### Predefined Ad Sizes
```swift
enum AdSize {
    case mobile1 // 320x320 or 300x250
    case mobile2 // 300x250 or 320x100
    case mobile3 // 300x250
    case mobile4 // 320x320
    case custom(width: CGFloat, height: CGFloat)
}
```

### Event-Driven Size Recheck System
- **YM Events**: `slotOnload`, `slotRenderEnded`, `slotVisibilityChanged`
- **GPT Events**: `gpt.events.SlotOnload`, `gpt.events.SlotRenderEnded`
- **Size Recheck Logic**: Trigger size detection only when YM/GPT indicates ad refresh
- **No Auto-Refresh**: Ad refresh handled entirely by YM/Prebid wrapper logic

### Navigation Lifecycle Management
```swift
// Global WebView management
WebAdView.shared.configure(unloadOnNavigation: true)

WebAdView.shared.onViewWillDisappear { viewId in
    // Unload all WebViews for this view
}

WebAdView.shared.onViewDidAppear { viewId in
    // Load WebViews for new view
}
```

### Two-Phase Ad Loading (HTML Template)
```javascript
// Phase 1: Fetch (triggered when WebView loads + at 200px distance)
// Native creates WebView, then sends fetch signal
ayManager.fetch(['div-gpt-ad-mobile_1']);

// Phase 2: Display (triggered at 100px distance)
ayManager.display(['div-gpt-ad-mobile_1']);
```

### Ad Labeling for Compliance
```swift
// Individual control
AdWebView(adUnitId: "mobile_1", showAdLabel: true)

// Global control
AdConfiguration(showAdLabels: true)

// Custom styling (future enhancement)
AdWebView(adUnitId: "mobile_1", adLabelStyle: .custom(text: "annonce", color: .gray))
```

## Module 5: Native View Lazy Loading (Two Tier) - Detailed Plan

This module is critical for performance and user experience, aiming to load and display ads only when they are approaching or within the user's viewport, similar to web-based lazy loading.

### Problem: Inefficient Ad Loading & Rendering

Loading all `WKWebView` instances and their ad content upfront, especially in long scrollable lists, leads to:
* High memory consumption.
* Increased CPU usage.
* Slower initial load times for the application.
* Wasted ad impressions for ads never seen by the user.

### Solution: Distance-Based WebView Fetching & Display

The strategy is to manage the lifecycle of `WKWebView` instances and their ad content based on their proximity to the user's visible screen area.

#### 5a. Distance-Based WebView Fetching

* **Objective:** Implement scroll position monitoring in the native SwiftUI view to determine when an ad unit is nearing the viewport.
* **Mechanism:**
    * **Scroll Position Monitoring:**
        * **iOS 17+:** Utilize SwiftUI's `.scrollPosition($scrollPosition)` modifier on the `ScrollView` to bind the current scroll offset. Changes to `scrollPosition` will trigger visibility checks.
        * **Older iOS Versions / Granular Control:** Employ `GeometryReader` within each `WebAdView` (or its container) combined with a `PreferenceKey`. This allows each ad unit to report its `CGRect` (frame) relative to a named `coordinateSpace` defined on the `ScrollView`. The `ScrollView`'s own visible bounds are then compared against these collected frames.
    * **Visibility Calculation:**
        * Define configurable thresholds: `fetchDistance` (e.g., 200px from viewport edge) and `renderDistance` (e.g., 100px from viewport edge).
        * For each `WebAdView`, compare its frame's `minY` and `maxY` with the `ScrollView`'s current visible `minY` and `maxY` (adjusted by `scrollOffset`).
    * **WebView Lifecycle States:** Introduce an `AdLoadState` enum (e.g., `notCreated`, `fetched`, `rendered`) for each `WebAdView` instance.
    * **Loading Logic:**
        * When an ad unit's top edge enters `fetchDistance` from the visible screen, transition its state to `fetched`. This triggers `WKWebView` creation and base HTML loading if not already done.
        * When an ad unit's top edge enters `renderDistance`, and it's already `fetched`, transition its state to `rendered`.

#### 5b. JS Fetch Event System

* **Objective:** Send a JavaScript "fetch" event to the `WKWebView` when the native view determines it's at `fetchDistance`.
* **Mechanism:**
    * Once a `WebAdView`'s state changes to `.fetched`, the native SwiftUI code will execute JavaScript using `webView.evaluateJavaScript("ayManager.fetch('\(adUnitId)');")`.
    * The JavaScript function `ayManager.fetch()` should be designed to *only* initiate the ad request (e.g., to Google Ad Manager or Prebid) without immediately rendering the ad creative. This allows for pre-bidding or pre-loading of ad data.
    * Implement optional JavaScript callbacks to communicate fetch completion back to the native side if needed, allowing for more granular state tracking (`readyToRender`).

#### 5c. JS Display Event System

* **Objective:** Send a JavaScript "display" event to the `WKWebView` when the native view determines it's at `renderDistance`.
* **Mechanism:**
    * When a `WebAdView`'s state changes to `.rendered`, the native SwiftUI code will execute JavaScript: `webView.evaluateJavaScript("ayManager.display('\(adUnitId)');")`.
    * The JavaScript function `ayManager.display()` will then trigger the actual rendering of the ad creative within the WebView's HTML content.

### General Considerations for Lazy Loading:

* **Performance:**
    * **Debounce/Throttle:** Limit the frequency of native-to-JS communication for visibility updates to prevent performance issues.
    * **Memory Management:** Implement explicit logic to unload/deallocate `WKWebView` instances when they scroll far out of view to free up memory.
* **Initial Load:** Ads visible on initial screen load should be fetched and rendered immediately without waiting for scroll events.
* **State Management:** Utilize `@State` or `@ObservedObject` within `WebAdView` to manage the `AdLoadState` and trigger UI/JS updates.

## Viewability Tracking Problem & Solution

### Problem: Inaccurate Viewability Reporting

Ad servers (e.g., GAM via `gpt.js`, Prebid wrappers like `ayManager`) determine viewability relative to the `WKWebView`'s frame, not the native app's screen. If a `WKWebView` is partially off-screen in the native view but entirely visible within its own frame, the ad server might incorrectly report 100% viewability, leading to discrepancies.

### Proposed Solution: Native-Controlled CSS Overlay

The idea is to use native-to-JS communication to control a CSS overlay within the `WKWebView` that visually masks parts of the ad not visible on the native screen.

#### Mechanism:

1.  **Native Visibility Calculation (Source of Truth):**
    * Leverage the same native scroll position monitoring (from Module 5a) to precisely calculate the *true visible portion* of each `WebAdView` on the native screen (e.g., visible percentage, or the `top`, `bottom` coordinates of the visible area relative to the ad's full height).
    * This native calculation is paramount.

2.  **Native-to-JS Communication:**
    * Establish a dedicated JavaScript message channel to send the calculated viewability data (`adUnitId`, `visibleTop`, `visibleBottom`, `visiblePercentage`, etc.) to the respective `WKWebView`.
    * Example: `webView.evaluateJavaScript("ayManager.updateViewability(\(adUnitId), { visibleTop: \(nativeVisibleTop), visibleBottom: \(nativeVisibleBottom) });")`

3.  **WebView CSS Overlay (Masking):**
    * Within the `WKWebView`'s HTML/CSS, for each ad unit, create a high-Z-index, transparent `div` element (the "overlay").
    * The `ayManager.updateViewability()` JavaScript function will receive the native visibility data.
    * It will then dynamically adjust the `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`, and potentially `opacity` of the CSS overlay to *cover* the portions of the ad that are *not* visible on the native screen.
    * **Example Implementation:** If the native side reports that only the bottom 50% of the ad is visible, the JavaScript would adjust the overlay to cover the top 50% of the ad's container within the WebView.

#### Advantages of this Approach:

* **Leverages Existing Web Mechanisms:** Ad servers' viewability scripts (e.g., `IntersectionObserver`, DOM element checks) will perceive the CSS overlay as an obstruction, leading to more accurate reporting.
* **Flexibility:** Provides fine-grained control over how viewability is presented to the ad server's client-side scripts.
* **Practicality:** A more manageable solution than trying to deeply integrate with or rewrite ad server SDKs' viewability logic.

### Potential Challenges and Mitigations:

1.  **Real-time Updates and Jitter:**
    * **Challenge:** Frequent, unthrottled updates can cause visual "flicker" or performance issues.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Debounce/Throttle:** Limit the frequency of `evaluateJavaScript` calls (e.g., every 50-100ms) from native to JS.
        * **Smooth CSS Transitions:** Apply CSS `transition` properties to the overlay's dynamic properties (`top`, `height`, etc.) for smooth visual changes.
        * **Buffer Zones:** Introduce a small pixel buffer (e.g., 10-20px) around the viewport edges when calculating visibility. This gives the WebView more time to react before the ad element fully crosses the true screen edge.
        * **Focus on Thresholds:** Ad viewability is often percentage-based (e.g., 50% for 1 second). Pixel-perfect, instantaneous updates aren't always necessary; focus on accurately hitting those key thresholds.

2.  **Performance Drag:**
    * **Challenge:** Excessive `evaluateJavaScript` calls and DOM manipulation can be resource-intensive.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Batch JS Calls:** If multiple ads are scrolling simultaneously, send a single JSON object containing data for all relevant ads in one `evaluateJavaScript` call, letting JS update multiple overlays.
        * **Minimal DOM Changes:** Ensure JavaScript updates only the necessary CSS properties. Using `transform` (e.g., `translateY`) can be more performant than `top` or `margin` for positioning, as it often allows for hardware acceleration.
        * **Profiling:** Use Xcode Instruments and browser developer tools (for WebView) to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

3.  **Ad Server SDK Sophistication & Open Measurement SDK (OM SDK):**
    * **Challenge:** Some ad server SDKs might employ more advanced viewability detection that could be harder to "mask" with a simple CSS overlay.
    * **Mitigation:**
        * **Thorough Testing:** Crucially, implement the solution and rigorously test the reported viewability metrics in your ad server's reporting dashboard. Compare against manual observation.
        * **Investigate IAB Open Measurement SDK (OM SDK):** This is the **most robust and recommended solution** if your ad partners support it.
            * **Concept:** OM SDK provides a standard API for third-party viewability measurement across native apps and web views. It consists of a native library and a JavaScript API (OMID).
            * **Integration:** You would register your `WKWebView` instance with the native OM SDK, providing it with the `WKWebView`'s `CGRect` relative to the native screen. The OM SDK then handles the complex viewability calculations and communicates with the ad server's JavaScript (which would also need to be integrated with OMID).
            * **Benefit:** This offloads the viewability complexity to a specialized, industry-standard SDK, ensuring higher accuracy and broader compatibility without needing custom CSS masking.
            * **Action:** Research specific integration guides for OM SDK with `WKWebView` for iOS, and verify if your ad partners (GAM, Prebid, etc.) support and recommend its use. This is often the preferred method for major ad platforms.

---

## Conclusion

The project is well-structured and has a clear path forward for implementing native lazy loading. The proposed CSS overlay approach for viewability tracking is a viable and commonly used method for bridging the gap between WebView-based ads and native screen visibility. However, the ultimate goal for viewability should be to explore and integrate with the **Open Measurement SDK** if supported by your ad partners, as it offers the most reliable and standardized solution for in-app ad measurement. By focusing on performance optimizations and thorough testing, a highly functional and performant ad view system can be achieved.

**Note**: This modular approach allows for focused development, easier testing, and clearer progress tracking. Each module builds upon the previous ones while maintaining distinct functional boundaries.
